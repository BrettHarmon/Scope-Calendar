# Scope-Calendar

Scope Calendar is a  senior design project designed and developed by York College of Pennsylvania students over the course of one semester. 

The mobile application is implemented using React Native to create a collaborative schedule or planner. The app allows users to create a group that set events with dates and times, and others may subscribe to that group. Doing so will populate their own personal schedule of all events from subscribed groups on the page first displayed when logging in.

Execution requires running the backend application server through a java compiler, and creating a Node.js instance to run the mobile app.
